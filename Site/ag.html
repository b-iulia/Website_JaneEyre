<p class="pg"><b>Aristocrats and their Gatherings</b></p> 
<p class="pg">Throughout Brontë’s novel, there are several fragments that suggest the behaviour and the activities of wealthier people from Victorian era, but the most remarkable ones are present in the part where, after being away for a couple of weeks, Mr. Rochester came back to Thornfield with some nobles, including Miss Blanche Ingram.
</p>
<p class="pg">Arriving at the manor, the women changed their clothing before joining the dinner, impressing with their dresses as well as with their attitudes, as Jane described. 
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">Every evening, after enjoying a copious meal, whilst the footmen were <i>“running to and fro”(Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>, the guests moved to the drawing-room. The women left the dining-room first. During this sequence, Jane emphasized their attitude towards her, their preoccupations, as well as their much-learned elegance and discretion.
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me. They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">When the coffee is brought in, the men are summoned, reinforcing the before mentioned atmosphere.
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">Afterwards, the guests spent time discussing various topics, sometimes gossiping, or listening to Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram singing, accompanied by piano, or playing different games until late at night. During these scenes, the woman’s position at that time and her restrictions regarding discussing certain subjects represent the focal point. <i>“Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">One of the games played, which is described in detail by Jane Eyre, is called <i>“playing charades”</i>. It consists of dividing the participants into two groups: one of them has to act out a theatrical scene, while the other one needs to guess the exact thing played. Certainly, the room was rearranged, suitable props were brought, and the ladies did not hesitate to dress up, creating a real stage atmosphere. Some of the roles or pictures presented were <i>“bride”</i>, <i>“the tableau of the whole”</i> (referring to Carol Maratta’s painting, <i>“Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well”</i>, which <i>“shows the story of Abraham's servant Eliezer giving Rebecca jewels to seal her betrothal to Isaac, after she had demonstrated the kindness foreseen by Abraham in offering water to Eliezer's camels (Gen. 24:11-20)”</i> ), <i>“Bridewell”</i> (a prison).
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades", but in my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room. Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. […] He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVIII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">There was no day when the visitors encountered boredom. <i>“Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVIII)</i>. During the sunny days, they spent plenty of time outside and chose to do excursions in the neighbourhood, <i>“some on horseback, the rest in carriages” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XVII)</i>.
