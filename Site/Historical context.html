<p class="pg">Charlotte Brontë was an English novelist and poet, born in 1816. She first published her masterpiece, “Jane Eyre”, in 1847 with a male pseudonym: Currer Bell. The book is set in Northern England in the nineteenth century, when the British society was in the process of industrialization.
</p>
<p class="pg">During this period, the family represented a central entity for all social classes, the most common difficulties encountered being excessive drinking, poor sanitation, or bad housing. In this century, mostly in the Victorian era, the number of children in a family gradually decreased, resulting in an increase in the amount of time parents allotted for each child.
</p>
<p class="pg">Women had limited rights and were supposed to be <i>“angelically pure and devoted to their family and home”</i>, as emphasized in the 1854 poem <i>“The Angel in the House”</i> by Coventry Patmore. They were not allowed to vote nor to be involved in political activities and they were kept away from the domain of commerce, paid work, and public speaking. Also, females had only certain rights to their family properties, their children, and their body. They were legally recognised exclusively as daughter, wife, widow, or mother. Briefly, women had to focus on the care of the household, of the family, as well as of the moral behaviour and religious aspects.  
</p>
<p class="pg">However, a few early feminists expanded their actions beyond the <i>“normal”</i> of that time, leading to some women riding bicycles, getting involved in worldwide activities, discussing politics and about the vote by the end of the century. Moreover, the idea of marriage based on real love, rather than on personal benefits, strategies, or money, became more popular. 
</p>
<p class="pg">In Brontë’s novel it can be observed a balance between the harshness of those times, the regulations imposed by the society and the politeness of people, which might be suggesting the significant improvement in the moral standards that took place during the nineteenth century.
