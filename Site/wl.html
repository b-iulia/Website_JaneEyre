    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:25px;">Social aspects</h2><br>
<p class="pg"><b>Women's lives</b></p> 
<p class="pg">During the nineteenth century, women had limited rights, an aspect that can be observed even from the beginning of the novel. Females were excluded from universities until 1870 and it was quite difficult for many to find a workplace apart from the household. Jane herself when she wanted to leave Lowood to discover more from the world had few options and accepted the first offer received. Also, she encountered difficulties in finding a position of employment when she was at Marsh End as well.
</p>
<p class="pg">Restricted by the boundaries society created for them, women who even dared to dream for more were labelled discontented. In Jane’s first weeks at the Thornfield manor, before meeting Mr. Rochester, she often spent time alone when she was reflecting on her situation at that moment. Although she was content with it, she was yearning to widen her knowledge, her acquaintances, to experience novel emotions.
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XII)</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">Stating that many might judge her thinking, Jane emphasized that her feelings are shared by many others who are dealing with an inner fight and a strong desire to discover the unexpected. Therefore, it is unfair to expect people to feel fulfilled with peace; <i>“human beings… must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XII)</i>.
</p>
<p class="pg">However, she highlighted women’s position in society at that time, that were narrowed to doing household activities, and the expectations people had from them. They were supposed to be content with their condition, regardless how miserable or lacking sense it was. These enforced unwritten rules lead to other wrong preconceptions, including the idea that women do not necessitate any kind of entertaining activities and that they should not expand their range of occupations.
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XII)</i>
