<p class="pg"><b>Love and marriage</b></p> 
<p class="pg">Jane’s belief regarding the feelings and the connection between spouses is directly expressed when discussing with Mr. Rochester the day after he proposed to her. Although she was undoubtedly looking forward to marrying Edward, she did not have high expectations, accepting the faith she was convinced to wait for her: the husband would soon become distant, lose interest in his wife and even stop loving her. Fortunately, the events turned out differently and they had a blessed, content marriage which was based on respect, true love, and equality.

<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>“‘What do you anticipate of me?’</i>
</p>
<p class="pg" style="margin-left:75px; margin-right:75px;"><i>‘For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,—a very little while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,—like me, I say, not love me. I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my dear master.’” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XXIV).</i>
</p>
<p class="pg">Not only did Charlotte Brontë reveal this opinion through her character, but she also presented it in a letter towards Ellen Nussey in 1840. She suggested that intense passion from a woman is not desired forasmuch as husband’s feelings of love and passion are certainly evanescent, lasting as long as the honeymoon, then sometimes being replaced by disgust.
