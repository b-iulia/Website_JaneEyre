    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:25px;">Charlotte Brontë</h2><br>
<p class="pg">Brontë’s writing style in this novel is definitely impressive, presenting unique, powerful, and complex characters. Moreover, Jane often addresses the reader. She wants to make herself understood and to communicate the feelings, the events, the atmospheres as accurate as possible for the lecturer. The narrator is creating a connection with the one behind the book and frequently makes a pause to give further explanations relating a certain aspect.
</p>
<p class="pg">Written as an autobiography, it is common for readers to wonder whether this is actually Charlotte Brontë’s life. The answer cannot be a plain one. No, she was not about to marry a man who secretly had an insane violent wife. However, there is a resemblance between the author and the character built by her.
</p>
<p class="pg">Charlotte was born in Yorkshire, England, in 1816, being part of a numerous family. Unfortunately, her mother died when she was only five years old and therefore, her aunt helped her father raise the children. At the age of eight, Charlotte was sent to a school for clergymen’s daughters with three of her sisters. A tuberculosis epidemic killed two of her sisters, so the other two girls were brought home and continued studying several years later. Afterwards, Charlotte became a teacher for a period of time, until she decided to work as a governess. She worked for two different families and she was extremely disappointed by this job in both cases. Consequently, she collaborated with her sisters to open their own school. Though this project was unsuccessful, as was the publishing of a poem book together, the three women gained experience and followed separate paths in literature where all of them flourished.
</p>
<p class="pg">Though Brontë’s first manuscript, <i>“The Professor”</i>, was not accepted for publishing, she was encouraged to send other future writings. Later that year, she finished the masterpiece that became her most known book. <i>“Jane Eyre”</i> impressed not only with its careful analysis of feelings and personalities, but also with its splendid writing style that blends multiple genres. It is a bildungsroman, following the protagonist’s evolution from an inexperienced little girl to an independent powerful woman who is able to handle even the toughest moments. Simultaneously, it includes romantic elements, the incontestable love between Jane and Mr. Rochester, as well as gothic elements, such as the supernatural incidents, the dark secret Edward Rochester hid, the mystery about Bertha Manson, all meant to create an atmosphere of terror and suspense.
</p>
<p class="pg">Another similarity between the main character and the author would be Charlotte’s inclination for painting. She personally did the drawings for the second edition of <i>“Jane Eyre”</i> and two of her paintings were presented at an exhibition in 1834.
</p>
<p class="pg">Unlike Jane, Brontë was not able to enjoy the birth of a child. She died at the age of 38, while pregnant. Some sources say the cause of her death was tuberculosis or pneumonia while others affirm that she had hyperemesis gravidarum (a pregnancy complication which causes excessive nausea and vomiting).
