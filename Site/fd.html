<p class="pg"><b>Family Roles and decisions</b></p> 
<p class="pg">During the nineteenth century, the father was the head of the family and the others must subdue to his rules. Not only were children’s desires insignificant, but they were also treated unfairly: the first-born son was favoured. Attention is brought to these aspects in Brontë’s novel as well, mostly in the sequence that narrates the way Edward Rochester became married to Bertha Mason. His greedy and stingy father decided to give the entire fortune to his older brother. However, he could not accept to have a poor son, concluding that Edward had to marry a rich woman. Mr. Mason, her father, an old acquaintance of his, who was <i>“a West India planter and merchant” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XXVII)</i>, was said to have a decent fortune. Given the period, his prosperity is most probably due to the work of slaves, as the abolition of slavery was legislated only in 1834 and ended only in 1838 in the Caribbean. Thus, his daughter, Bertha, was chosen to become the wife, without knowing her that well, or asking for Edward’s approval.
</p>
<p class="pg">Up until 1857, when the divorce law appeared, a special act of Parliament was necessary for the separation of spouses. Therefore, even without Bertha’s madness, it would have been extremely difficult for Mr. Rochester to obtain the divorce. Although he mentions this idea when discussing with Jane <i>(“And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife was mad” – Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre, Chapter XXVII)</i>, he was probably referring to method of separation by means of a document under private signature, containing a clause by which both parts agreed not to prosecute each other.
